bz2file provides a Python API for reading and writing bzip2-compressed files.

Its purpose is to make features from the latest version of Python available for
users of older versions. This module contains the BZ2File class from the Python
3.3 standard library, adapted to work under Python 2.6 and 2.7 (as well as 3.x).

Features:
* Correctly decompresses multi-stream files (such as those created by pbzip2)
* Can read from/write to any file-like object (doesn't use stdio directly)
* Added methods: peek, read1, readinto, fileno, readable, writable, seekable
